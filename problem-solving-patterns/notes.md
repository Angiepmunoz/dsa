# Problem Solving Patterns

## Frequency Counters
- This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
- This can often often avoid the need for nested loops or O(n^2) operations with arrays/strings

## Multiple Pointers
- Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition
- very efficient for solving problems
- Searching for something that meets a condition (usually a pair)
- We use two references (i and j)

## Sliding Window
- This pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another
- Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created)
- Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.

## Divide and Conquer
- This pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data
    - Take a larger set of data
    - Divide on 
- This patter can tremendously decrease time complexity
- Quick sort and Merge sort are examples of divide and conquer
