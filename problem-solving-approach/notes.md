# Algorithms and Problem Solving Patterns

## Basic Approach 
- **An algorithm** - a process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task
1. Devise a plan for solving problems
   1. Understand the Problem
   2. Break it down
   3. Solve and simplify
   4. Look back and refactor
## Problem Solving
### Step 1: Understand the Problem
1. Can I restate the problem in my own words
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
4. Can the outbuts be determined from the inputs?
5. How should i label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

### Step 2: Explore Examples
- Coming up w/ examples can help you understand the problem better
- Examples also provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it should

1. Start with a simple example
2. Progress to more complex examples
3. explore examples with emptyh inputs
4. explore with invalid inputs (edge cases)
6. Master common problem solving patterns

### Step 3: Break it Down
- Sudo code

### Step 4: Solve/Simplify
- Solve the problem and if you can't solve a simpler problem
1. Find the core difficulty
2. Temporarily ignore that difficulty
3. Write simplified solution
4. The incorporate that difficulty back in
   1. Hopefully, while working on the simple bits you gain some insight on the harder bits

### Step 5: Look back and Refactor
